# Overview

This is our submission for the Code Institute August Hackathon: Pixel Pioneers.

The hackathon is a rapid and collaborative event where teams of about 5 or 6 individuals work together on software projects in sprints with the goal of creating a functioning end product within just a few days.

Team Members:

- [Jaimie](https://github.com/JaimieHemmings)
- [Noah](https://github.com/Noah-Samawi)
- [Mihály](https://github.com/Nmyhi)
- [Chris](https://github.com/Chris-Tranter)
- [Oliver](https://github.com)
- 

The goal of this Hackathon event is to create a Retro Game, including the use of 8 bit graphics, sound effects and music. As a group we came together to discuss previous retro games we have enjoyed including Tetris, Road Rash, Z, Worms, Duck Hunt etc.

We believed that creating something along the lines of an RPG would cause us issues with scoping the project appropriately to suit the alotted timeframe and so we eventually decided we would create, in homage to the original, a Duck Hunt clone and so "Duck Hunt Remastered" was conceptualised.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

DuckHunt Reloaded is the rethinking of the old classic DuchHunt

### User Stories

* As a player, I want to see the main menu.
* As a player, I want to start a new game.
* As a player, I want to view the leaderboard.
* As a player, I want to shoot ducks that fly across the screen.
* As a player, I want to experience a variety of environments (e.g., forest, swamp, winter landscape), so that the game remains visually engaging and varied.
* As a player, I want to save my score on the leaderboard.
* As a player, I want to have instructions. 

#### Client Goals

As the client I would to:

- Create an engaging and fun 8 bit retro style game
- Make the game replayable
- Have a persistent leaderboard that contains all the high scores

#### First Time Visitor Goals

As a first time visitor I would like:

- To immediately understand the purpose the website
- To be able to understand the rules of the game
- To be able to play the game
- To submit my score to the leaderboards

#### Returning Visitor Goals

As a returning visitor I would like:

- Try and beat my high score
- Revisit the rules to get clarification if needed

## Design

* We were following the original game design in terms of srt style.
* We were implementing new game mechanics. Shorter rounds and more birds at the same time.

### Database

* We have used Firebase for our database.
* Database model:

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme and overall aesthetic of the website will be based on retro style 8 bit video games, obviously taking great inspiration from the graphical style of the original Duck Hunt game.

### Typography

[Jersey-10](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jersey+10?query=jersey+10 "Retro looking google font") google font was used to create retro looking text.

### Imagery

For the imagery of the website we have found some open source sprites true to the original version of the game.

### Wireframes

  - The homepage will be the home of the overhwleming majority of the website content, if not all of it.
  - See the instructions for the game
  - Play the game
  - See the leaderboards
  - Submit a high score

### Future Implementations

Continued development could include further development to implement the following:

- A variety of game modes (Crazy mode - would infinitely spawn an overwhelming number of targets for the player to shoot)

### Accessibility

* Semantic html was used for accessibility.

## Technologies Used

HTML5, CSS, Javascript

### Languages Used

* HTML
* CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

* [Balsamiq](https://www.balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamiq Wireframing Tool") was used to create the wireframes/sitemap for the site.
* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/ "8 bit sounds free library") was used for downloading sound effects and music.
* [Miro](https://miro.com/ "creative project manager software") was used for brainstorming and making notes, task list.
* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/ "cloud based IDE") was used for development.
* [Git](https://github.com/ "Version Control System") was used for developers to work on their own branch. Once approved changes would be merged into the main repository.
* [FireBase](https://https://firebase.google.com/ "Database") was used for our database.
